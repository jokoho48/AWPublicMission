/*
unit loadout script by joko
Idea by Belbo
creates a specific loadout for playable units. Add the items to their respective variables. (expected data type is given).
The kind of ammo a player gets with this loadout does not necessarily have to be specified. If tracer ammo is supposed to be used, you should set JK_primaryweaponAmmo to 0 and add those
magazines one for one in JK_items.
